# MUSIC-GENRES-CLUSTERING-AUTO-ML
This project utilizes AutoML for clustering songs based on various features, including Energy, Danceability, Loudness (dB), Liveness, Valence, Length (Duration), Acousticness, Speechiness, and Popularity. By grouping songs with similar characteristics, we aim to reveal similarities between music genres, providing listeners with diverse experiences.
